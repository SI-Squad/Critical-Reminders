# Critical Reminders

Hello! Thank you for your interest in Critical Reminders. 

Our tool is meant for RIT students to quickly and easily add homework, quizzes, and tests to whatever calendar they prefer via Chrome extension. The following instructions are for those who would like to download the Chrome extension locally (and make any changes).

## Installing Locally

1. Download or clone the repository onto your local machine. Make sure to put it somewhere you'll remember if you plan on making changes to it.
2. Open Google Chrome and visit chrome://extensions/
3. In the top right of your browser, switch on "Developer mode." You should see a number new features pop up all over the page.
4. In the top left of your browser, click on "Load unpacked." 
5. Select the repository/directory with the Chrome extension in it. Once the Chrome extension is loaded, it should look something like this:

6. (optional, but useful) In the top right of your browser, click on the puzzle piece icon. In this popup, find the Critical Reminders extension and click the push pin on the right (make sure it is blue).

## Running the Extension

NOTE: This extension should only work when on the Assignments or Quizzes page in MyCourses (possibily RIT specific).

1. Open the Assignments or Quizzes page in MyCourses.
2. Open the extension (or press Control+Shift+I, works both PC and Mac) and press "Find Deadlines."
3. After the extension grabs all of your assignments, feel free to add as many events as you'd like. All of the events you add will be put into a single .ics file.
4. Add the .ics file to any of the following calendars. Helpful links are included in the extension.

## Removing the Local Extension

1. Return to chrome://extensions
2. Find the extension you'd like to remove and press "Remove."
3. (optional) Turn off developer mode by pressing the switch in the top right of the browser.
